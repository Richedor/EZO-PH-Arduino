 * Project: Serial communication between an Atlas Scientific pH sensor and an Arduino.
 * Description : This project displays the pH measurement every second using an EZOâ„¢ pH Circuit sensor from Atlas Scientific connected to an Arduino microcontroller. The sensor can be configured to communicate via UART or I2C.
